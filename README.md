# Orbit

`@strakzat/orbit` — central annotation & feedback engine. One package, many projects.

Orbit does three things, and you can adopt them one at a time:

1. **An in-app overlay** clients use on a staging build — annotations you write for
   them, and a feedback Inspector where they click any element and leave a comment.
2. **A comments API** (on Vercel, or the built-in Vite dev plugin locally) that
   stores those comments in a Notion database.
3. **A feedback → PR automation** (a GitHub Action) that, daily or on demand, turns
   the open Notion feedback into a branch with one commit per point and a pull
   request with a checklist you review, tweak and merge.

## How the feedback loop works

```
Client clicks an element on staging, leaves a comment
        │
        ▼
Comments API (Vercel / Vite dev plugin)  ──►  Notion "Feedback" database  (status: Open)
        │
        ▼
GitHub Action "Orbit feedback"  (weekdays 18:00, or Run workflow)
   • claims the open points (status: In behandeling)
   • AI makes one commit per point on a feedback/<date> branch
   • opens a PR with a checklist                            (status: In review)
        │
        ▼
You review the PR
   • uncheck a point  ──►  its commit is reverted           (status: Afgewezen)
   • merge            ──►  checked points kept               (status: Opgelost)
```

Every point is tied to its commit by a `Orbit-Feedback: <notion-page-id>` trailer,
so unchecking a box in the PR body maps back to exactly one commit and one Notion
row.

## Environment variables — where each one goes

The three parts run in three places, so the same Notion values are set in more than
one spot. Nothing here is optional unless marked.

**Vercel** (the comments API deployment) — Project → Settings → Environment Variables:

| Variable | What it is |
|---|---|
| `NOTION_API_KEY` | Secret of a Notion internal integration (starts with `ntn_`) |
| `NOTION_DATABASE_ID` | The Feedback database's id (32 chars from its URL) |
| `NOTION_PROJECT_ID` | The project's page id in your Projects database (the relation target) |

**GitHub Actions** (the client repo) — Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → **Secrets**:

| Secret | What it is |
|---|---|
| `NOTION_API_KEY` | Same value as in Vercel |
| `NOTION_DATABASE_ID` | Same value as in Vercel |
| `NOTION_PROJECT_ID` | Same value as in Vercel |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` | From `claude setup-token` — lets the Action run Claude on your subscription |
| `ORBIT_GH_TOKEN` | *Optional.* A PAT (repo scope). Needed if the repo can't create PRs with the default token, or if you want CI to run on the feedback PR |
| `ORBIT_NPM_TOKEN` | *Optional.* A PAT with `read:packages`. Needed only if the repo can't read the `@strakzat/orbit` package with its default token |

**Local development** (the client app) — a `.env` in the project root, read by the
Vite dev plugin so feedback works without deploying the API:

```dotenv
NOTION_API_KEY=ntn_...
NOTION_DATABASE_ID=...
NOTION_PROJECT_ID=...
```

Two GitHub **repository settings** also matter for the automation (not env vars):

- **Package read access** — set the `@strakzat/orbit` package to **Internal**
  visibility, or add the repo under the package's **Manage Actions access**, so the
  Action's token may install it. (Otherwise use `ORBIT_NPM_TOKEN`.)
- **PR creation** — enable **Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull
  requests** under Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions. (Otherwise
  use `ORBIT_GH_TOKEN`.)

---

## Install

### 1. Install the package

```bash
npm install @strakzat/orbit
```

The package lives on GitHub Packages, so your project's `.npmrc` needs:

```
@strakzat:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=${NPM_TOKEN}
```

Set `NPM_TOKEN` in your shell (and, for CI, as the `ORBIT_NPM_TOKEN` secret) to a
GitHub PAT with at least `read:packages`.

### 2. Add the overlay to the app

```bash
npx orbit-init
```

This finds your root layout, adds the imports, wraps it in `<AnnotationProvider>`
and drops in `<AnnotationButton />` and `<AnnotationPanel />`. It's idempotent. See
[Manual setup](#manual-setup) if you'd rather wire it up yourself, and enable the
feedback Inspector by passing a `comments` config (below).

### 3. Create the Notion database and integration

- Create (or reuse) a **Feedback** database with the [schema below](#notion-schema).
  `Project` is a **relation** to your Projects database.
- Create a Notion **internal integration** (notion.so/my-integrations) and copy its
  secret — this is `NOTION_API_KEY`.
- **Share both databases** with that integration (the Feedback DB *and* the Projects
  DB it relates to) via each database's ••• → Connections. Without access to the
  Projects DB, Notion hides the `Project` relation from the API.

### 4. Deploy the comments API

The widget POSTs comments to `/api/comments` and reads them back with GET. Build that
endpoint with the server helpers and deploy it (e.g. on Vercel), setting the three
Notion variables there:

```ts
import { buildNotionCommentProperties, parseNotionComment } from "@strakzat/orbit/server";
```

See [Server helpers](#server-helpers-for-the-comments-api) for the full handler. For
local development you don't need the deployed API — add the Vite dev plugin instead:

```ts
// vite.config.ts
import { annotationsDevApi } from "@strakzat/orbit/vite";
export default defineConfig({ plugins: [annotationsDevApi(), react()] });
```

It serves `/api/comments` from your `.env` during `vite dev`.

Point the overlay at the API and enable the Inspector:

```tsx
<AnnotationProvider
  annotations={annotations}
  currentRoute={pathname}
  comments={{
    enabled: true,
    apiBase: "",                       // same-origin; or your Vercel URL
    project: import.meta.env.VITE_NOTION_PROJECT_ID,
  }}
>
```

### 5. Set up the feedback → PR automation

In the client repo:

```bash
npx orbit-feedback init
```

This copies two GitHub workflows and a Claude Code skill into the project. Then:

1. Add the GitHub **secrets** from the table above (`NOTION_*`,
   `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`, and the optional PATs).
2. Enable the two repo **settings** (package access, PR creation).
3. Verify everything:

   ```bash
   npx orbit-feedback init --check
   ```

   This checks the Notion schema (properties and statuses) and whether GitHub
   Actions is allowed to open PRs, and tells you exactly what's missing.

The scheduled run fires on weekdays at 18:00 Amsterdam time; start it by hand from
the Actions tab ("Orbit feedback" → Run workflow). The `orbit-feedback` label is
created automatically on the first run.

---

## Notion schema

The Feedback database needs these properties (Dutch names, exactly):

| Property | Type | Holds |
|---|---|---|
| `Naam` | Title | Auto-filled summary |
| `Project` | **Relation** | Link to the Projects database (keyed by `NOTION_PROJECT_ID`) |
| `Annotatie ID` | Text | CSS path or annotation id of the element |
| `Comment` | Text | The client's comment |
| `Auteur` | Text | Client name |
| `Status` | Select | `Open`, `In behandeling`, `In review`, `Opgelost`, `Afgewezen` |
| `Pagina` | Text | The page/route the comment is on |
| `Label` | Text | Tag + text of the element |
| `Component` | Text | React component name (when available) |
| `Bron` | Text | `file:line` of the element (when available) |
| `Antwoord` | Text | Reply shown back to the client |
| `PR` | URL | Link to the feedback PR |

`npx orbit-feedback init --check` validates all of this.

---

## The automation in detail

- **Scale.** The bot addresses each point the way a developer would — a new
  component, a modal, multiple files — not the smallest possible edit. Everything
  lands as a reviewable, revertable PR, so it can be eager.
- **Caveats.** When it makes an assumption about approach, scope or place, it makes
  the change anyway and records a `Kanttekening:` line in the commit body. These are
  collected into a **Kanttekeningen** section at the bottom of the PR.
- **Skips.** It only skips genuinely non-code points (a compliment, a question) or a
  target it truly can't locate; a point needing a new dependency is skipped with a
  reason (it never touches `package.json` or lockfiles). Skip reasons are written
  back to Notion as the answer, and every run uploads its `.orbit/` folder (manifest,
  results, PR body) as a run artifact so you can read them — the AI step hides its
  own output.
- **No changes.** If every point is skipped, no PR is opened and each point is
  released back to `Open` with its reason.
- **Cleanup & self-healing.** A merged PR's `feedback/<date>` branch is deleted, and
  a cancelled run's claims recover: both workflows release `In behandeling` points
  older than six hours back to `Open` at the start of the next run.

### Run it locally

```bash
# with NOTION_API_KEY, NOTION_DATABASE_ID and NOTION_PROJECT_ID set
/orbit-feedback
```

Reject a point outside the PR flow:

```bash
npx orbit-feedback sync --pr 42 && git push
```

### CLI

| Command | Does |
|---------|------|
| `orbit-feedback fetch` | Pulls open feedback → `.orbit/feedback.json` (`--claim` sets In behandeling) |
| `orbit-feedback status` | Updates Notion status (`--set`, `--pr`, `--antwoord`, `--stale <hours>`) |
| `orbit-feedback pr-body` | Builds the PR checklist (and Kanttekeningen) from the manifest + git trailers |
| `orbit-feedback sync` | Handles check/uncheck: revert + status update |
| `orbit-feedback init` | Copies skill + workflows (`--check` validates schema and PR permission) |

> **Source capture** (sending the React component name and source file with a
> comment, so the AI maps feedback to code more precisely) is a planned follow-up;
> the AI currently falls back to the label, page and element path.

## Manual setup

### 1. Provider + Button + Panel in your root layout

```tsx
import {
  AnnotationProvider,
  AnnotationButton,
  AnnotationPanel,
} from "@strakzat/orbit";
import { useLocation } from "react-router-dom";
import { annotations } from "@/annotations/data";

export default function RootLayout() {
  const { pathname } = useLocation();

  return (
    <AnnotationProvider annotations={annotations} currentRoute={pathname}>
      {/* your app content */}
      <Outlet />

      <AnnotationButton />
      <AnnotationPanel />
    </AnnotationProvider>
  );
}
```

### 2. Annotations data in your project

```ts
// src/annotations/data.ts
import type { Annotation } from "@strakzat/orbit";

export const annotations: Annotation[] = [
  {
    id: "1",
    target: "dashboard",
    title: "Welcome to the dashboard",
    body: "Here you'll find an overview of all the relevant data.",
    author: "Elwin",
    date: "2026-03-30",
    type: "info",
  },
  {
    id: "2",
    target: "dashboard/orders",
    elementId: "order-table",
    title: "New column: status",
    body: "We added a status column so you can see at a glance where each order stands.",
    author: "Jasper",
    date: "2026-03-31",
    type: "new",
  },
];
```

### 3. AnnotationMarker on elements

```tsx
import { AnnotationMarker } from "@strakzat/orbit";

function OrderTable() {
  return (
    <AnnotationMarker annotationId="2" position="top-right">
      <table>{/* ... */}</table>
    </AnnotationMarker>
  );
}
```

### 4. Context stack for dialogs/panels

```tsx
import { useAnnotations } from "@strakzat/orbit";

function ConversationDialog() {
  const { pushContext, popContext } = useAnnotations();

  useEffect(() => {
    pushContext("dialog:conversation");
    return () => popContext();
  }, [pushContext, popContext]);

  return <div>{/* dialog content */}</div>;
}
```

### 5. Add annotation IDs automatically

Run the scanner to find UI elements and add `data-annotation-id` attributes automatically:

```bash
npx orbit-scan
```

This scans your `src/` folder for navigation, tables, forms, cards, modals, etc. and offers to add stable IDs. The feedback inspector recognises these IDs automatically when users leave comments.

> **Tip:** after `orbit-init`, `orbit-scan` is the logical next step to label your UI elements.

### Server helpers for the comments API

The package exports server-side helpers for your Notion comments API:

```ts
import {
  buildNotionCommentProperties,
  parseNotionComment,
} from "@strakzat/orbit/server";
```

**POST handler**: builds all the Notion properties (including the `pagina` field):

```ts
const { annotationId, auteur, comment, pagina, label } = req.body;
const properties = buildNotionCommentProperties(
  { annotationId, auteur, comment, pagina, label },
  NOTION_PROJECT_ID
);

await fetch(`https://api.notion.com/v1/pages`, {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${NOTION_API_KEY}`,
    "Notion-Version": "2022-06-28",
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    parent: { database_id: NOTION_DATABASE_ID },
    properties,
  }),
});
```

**GET handler**: parses Notion pages into Comment objects:

```ts
const data = await response.json();
const comments = data.results.map(parseNotionComment);
```

---

## Configuration

### Settings

```tsx
<AnnotationProvider
  annotations={data}
  currentRoute={pathname}
  settings={{
    togglePosition: "bottom-right",  // button position
    defaultVisible: false,           // start with annotations on/off
    accentColor: "#1567a4",          // accent colour
    panelWidth: 420,                 // panel width in px
    panelHeight: 640,                // panel height in px
    zIndex: 9000,                    // base z-index
    keyboardShortcut: true,          // Cmd+. / Ctrl+. toggle
  }}
>
```

### Labels (i18n)

```tsx
<AnnotationProvider
  annotations={data}
  currentRoute={pathname}
  labels={{
    toggleShow: "Show annotations",
    toggleHide: "Hide annotations",
    tabCurrentPage: "This page",
    tabAll: "All",
    searchPlaceholder: "Search annotations...",
    panelTitle: "Annotations",
    noResults: "No results",
  }}
>
```

---

## Route matching

Annotations are filtered by `target` against `currentRoute`:

- **Exact match**: `"dashboard/orders"` matches `/dashboard/orders`
- **Wildcards**: `"projects/:id/details"` matches `/projects/123/details`
- **Global**: `"global"` always matches, on every page
- **Context**: `"dialog:conversation"` matches when `pushContext("dialog:conversation")` is active
